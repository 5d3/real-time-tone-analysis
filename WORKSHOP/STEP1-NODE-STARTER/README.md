**Starting the workshop ...**

Welcome to our 'Real Time Tone' analysis workshop. This workshop was designed to help immerse you in Bluemix, Watson and Node.js ... to offer at taste of life developing in the cloud.

**Goals:**

1. Understand the workflow for Bluemix/CloudFoundry
2. Experience Node.js development in the Cloud
3. Create and bind cognitive/natural language services
4. Manage data in the Cloud
5. Think about short, meaningful experiments and updates that connect, data, cloud and cognitive computing

**STEP 1**

- Create a fresh, new github project, and clone it to your desktop.

- Open up the Bluemix UI and navigate to the JavaScript Starter, to create a NodeJS hello world app.

- Give it a unique name. The name you give the project will form part of the path that you type into a web broswer to see your running app.

- For instance realtime-tone-am  - use your initals, we'll all be creating our own real time tone app, and they each need a unique name. Bluemix will reject a name that already exists.

- Download the code from the links Bluemix offers, and save it in the empty project that you created.

- Navigate to your app - for instance realtime-tone-am.mybluemix.net 

- Now we're going to begin with a basic workflow. We'll make the app run locally on our computers, change things a little and then upload to the cloud.
- First we'll spend some time learning about npm.org, exploring a few packages for databases, social media, algorithms ... we'll worj with npm install, manifest files, dependencies
- We'll change the hello world text, see it run locally and then work with the cf command line
- Using the cf command line we'll deploy our app, and then check what happens.
- Let's return to the Bluemix UI and look at the logs there.
- Let's expore the cf command logs a little
- We'll update the app.js file with some console.logs and then watch the messages appear in our shell. We'll deploy and see them.
- We'll be careful with logging ... to leave breadcrumbs for ourself to check back on as we work through the workshop

OK - that's the grounding we need for the next step ... adding our first service ...
