# Real Time Tone Analysis Workshop
Welcome to the Real Time Tone Analysis workshop! In this workshop, you will learn how to put together a Node.js app that leverages several Watson services and interfaces with a Cloudant microservice. However, we will learn much more than that. Read on to understand everything this workshop has to offer.

## Steps
1. **Node Starter** - We will kick things off by learning how to use Cloud Foundry runtimes on Bluemix, Node.js basics, and how to interpret our logs.

2. **Speech to Text** - This section will get into working with Bluemix services, Watson, and creating environment parity with Cloud Foundry.

3. **Adding a DBaaS** - We will connect our app to a database in the backend and by doing so, learn about Loopback.io and creating microservices on the Bluemix platform.

4. **Tone Analyzer** - This section goes over another Watson service, additonal capabilities of the CF CLI, and gives an introduction to Watson patterns.

5. **Real Time Plotting** - This section puts our Watson results to good use by expanding the UI to provide real time cognitive feedback.
